My Personal Dataset Project

## Motivation

## Data Source

## Processing

First, collecting the data was very simple as basketballreference.com provides an ongoing database for all NBA stats. Processing the data was not very difficult thanks to the convienence provided from the basketball reference database. For all the plots shown below, I used a similar procedure to process my data. I started off by sorting the data in descending order from most three pointers attempted to the least. Then, I used the feature on basketball reference that allowed me to delete columns to filter out unwanted data. For some plots, I also deleted rows in order to show the players or teams that were at the top that season. From there, I created multiple .csv files for my respective visuals and inputted these files to Excel and R. In Excel, I plotted boxplots with multiple categorical variables to show the shot breakdown in comparing seasons. In R, I made a simple boxplots to show the Warriors team that began the revelation of the modern NBA. I also used R to conduct exploratory data analysis by comparing boxplots of two seasons.
